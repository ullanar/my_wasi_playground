# What is that page

Basically in that journey we need a some way to structure information we learned. And somehow document our progress to revisit it again one day to remind yourself some concepts.

So that page will serve as a index of all underlying docs.

## ! ALARM ! WARNING ! ATTENTION !
Some of data will be generated by AI. I need a fast way to document all my findings. So when I will understand some topic I probably will document it using AI.

If you completely dont trust the AI it is probably will be better to read, get some points from it and validate it yourself.
